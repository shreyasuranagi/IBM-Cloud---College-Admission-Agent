# Problem Statement

Prospective students find it overwhelming navigating through the admission process. They often face difficulties finding accurate information about eligibility, deadlines, fee structures, course options, and application procedures. Traditional support systems, such as helpdesks and static web pages, struggle to meet the growing demand for instant, reliable, and personalized responses.

# Solution

To address this, the proposed solution is a College Admission Agent powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This intelligent assistant retrieves and summarizes admission policies, FAQs, and course-related content from institutional sources, providing students with accurate, real-time answers to natural language queries.
By automating common inquiries and offering clear, policy-grounded information, the agent not only reduces the burden on administrative staff but also enhances transparency, accessibility, and overall student experience during the admissions journey.
